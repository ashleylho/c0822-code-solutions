        <h2>It puts care at your command</h2>
        <p>You don't have to click a dozen times to order a flu shot or bounce around five windows to discover the
          latest blood count. Canvas pulls everything you need directly into your note, so you never have to leave it.
          And because Canvas learns from every interaction, it gets smarter with every patient you see.

        <blockquote>Canvas works three times as fast, improves performance dramatically on key quality metrics, and is incredibly
          easy to use. The right information is presented in the right way at the right time, and the product leverages
          technology to actually improve the quality of care I provide.
